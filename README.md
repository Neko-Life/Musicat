I know this is a mess so meet me on [discord](https://www.discord.gg/vpk2KyKHtu) if you're so pissed looking at this abomination of catastrophic terribleness...

## Config

Fill the config in "[exe](https://github.com/Neko-Life/Musicat/tree/player/exe)" folder, rename it to `sha_conf.example.json` then move it with your exe output. 
```json
{
    "SHA_TKN": "",
    "SHA_PREFIX": "\\!",
}
```
- SHA_TKN = Your mom number (bot discord token)
- SHA_PREFIX = Bot prefix
